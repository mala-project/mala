# ML-DFT@CASUS

ML-DFT is a machine-learning based framework to enable multiscale modeling by bypassing computationally expensive density functional simulations. It is designed as a python package. This repository is structured as follows:

    * examples/ : contains useful examples to get you started with the package
    * install/ : contains informations and scripts for setting up this package on your machine
    * fesl/ : the source code itself
    * test/ : several test scripts used durind development

## Installation

Please refer to the `install/` subdirectory.

## Running

You can familiarize yourself with the usage of this package by running the examples in the ```example/``` folder.

## Data

*coming soon*
