MALA tools (Materials Analysis and Learning) is a machine-learning based
framework to enable multiscale modeling by bypassing computationally
expensive density functional simulations. It is designed as a python
package. This repository is structured as follows:

```
├── examples : contains useful examples to get you started with the package
├── install : contains scripts for setting up this package on your machine
├── mala : the source code itself
├── test : test scripts used during development, will hold tests for CI in the future
└── docs : Sphinx documentation folder
```

## Installation

Please refer to [Installation of MALA](docs/source/install/README.md).

## Running

You can familiarize yourself with the usage of this package by running
the examples in the `example/` folder.
