MALA tools (Materials Analysis and Learning) is a machine-learning
based framework to enable multiscale modeling by bypassing
computationally expensive density functional simulations. It is designed
as a python package. This repository is structured as follows:

.. code::

   ├── examples : contains useful examples to get you started with the package
   ├── install : contains scripts for setting up this package on your machine
   ├── mala : the source code itself
   ├── test : test scripts used during development, will hold tests for CI in the future
   └── docs : Sphinx documentation folder


Installation
------------

Please refer to `Installation of MALA <https://multiscale-wdm.pages.hzdr.de/surrogate-models/fesl/fesl/install/README.html>`_.

Running
-------

You can familiarize yourself with the usage of this package by running
the examples in the ``example/`` folder.
