Getting started with MALA
=========================

The following guide gives an introduction on how to use MALA.
It follows the basic examples in the official MALA repository and covers
all necessary steps to build and use an ML-DFT model with MALA.
Advanced features and performance tweaks are ignored, and instead covered in
:doc:`the advanced section <advanced_usage>`.

This also refers to hardware acceleration of computations. This guide
will help you familiarize yourself with the MALA code, but always assume
execution on a single CPU; GPU usage and CPU parallelization are covered
in the advanced section as well.
